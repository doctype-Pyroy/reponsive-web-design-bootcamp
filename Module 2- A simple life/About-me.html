                        <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>

                        <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, 
                        but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>

                        <p> Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to 
                            live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>

                        <h3 class="subtitle">How I turned things around</h3>

                        <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I literally 
                            put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, 
                            and I quit my job. It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a 
                            bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle">Now I live the simple life</h3>

                        <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. 
                            I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>

                        <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong> felt like I had no choice but 
                            to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a 
                            simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
